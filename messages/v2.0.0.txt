Sublemacs Pro v2 has landed
===========================

Sublemacs got a new core contributor, @canoeberry, who rewrote essential parts
of sublemacs to improve performance and add more features. This new version is
a Sublime Text 3 only version as the old APIs do not allow us to add all the
features we want. Sublemacs for ST2 will go into maintenance only mode.

Here are the awesome new features:

  * Real emacs like incremental search using C-S, including repeating the last search
  * Better and improved kill ring and mark ring handling
  * Numeric arguments to movement commands: `meta+2` `meta+3` `ctrl+F` means go forward 23 characters.
  * And many more...
